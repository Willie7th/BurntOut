# Burnt Out

## Installation

Burnt Out uses Unity 6 (since it has support for shadow maps on tile maps). Follow the usual installation and build steps i.e. `File > Build and Run`.

## Attributions

Flame animation loosely based on a tutorial youtube channel Sirhaian, available [here](https://youtu.be/5Mw6NpSEb2o?si=9mpBVNYDVZqXsiVf).

## Note
All 7 levels are available now for playthrough (each increasing in difficulty). Game would normally start with only level 1.
Level Difficulty:
1 - Very easy
2 - easy
3 - medium 
4 - easy/medium  (first required mini flame lvl)
5 - hard
6 - hard/very hard
7 - very hard

## Known Bugs

1. Mini-flame spawning in walls
Spawning a mini-flame when directly in front of a wall can cause it to spawn into the wall's collision box. Level needs to be restarted

## Future Work
More levels (between current levels).
Mechanic refinement (valid splitting and improved jumping).
