# Burnt Out

## Installation

Burnt Out uses Unity 6 (since it has support for shadow maps on tile maps). Follow the usual installation and build steps i.e. `File > Build and Run`.

## Attributions

Flame animation loosely based on a tutorial youtube channel Sirhaian, available [here](https://youtu.be/5Mw6NpSEb2o?si=9mpBVNYDVZqXsiVf)

## Known Bugs

1. Mini-flame spawning in walls
Spawning a mini-flame when directly in front of a wall can cause it to spawn into the wall's collision box. Level needs to be restarted
